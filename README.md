# German Story Bot
### Overview

The German Story Bot is a Telegram bot designed to help German language learners by providing them with German stories tailored to their proficiency level. Users can choose their story level (A1, A2, B1) and receive stories every 6 hours. Additionally, new users receive an initial story based on the level they choose.
